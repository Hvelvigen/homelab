# Documentation

This directory is where all the learned, argued-with, refined, rebuilt, and battle-tested practices of my homelab end up living.

If you're here, you probably want structure — or at least a fighting chance of avoiding the “Christmas tree doing its best mountain goat impression on Everest” situation. Trust me, that thing is *precarious* at best and fully airborne at worst.

The goal of this documentation is simple:

- share the patterns and approaches I've developed across **6(.5)** designed homelab iterations  
- honour the countless *progenitors* that didn’t make it past their awkward teenage phases  
- give you ideas you can actually use  
- help future-you avoid the “why is everything on fire?” arc and move straight to the “oooooh, what does this button do?” arc

You’ll find guidance here on:

- how to structure and document your homelab in a consistent, deliberate way  
- how to name things sensibly so future-you doesn’t hurl a colorful metaphor or two at past-you  
- how to design hosts, services, and patterns that stay predictable across rebuilds  
- how to organise layers and components so everything remains clear, reproducible, and maintainable

This isn’t meant to be read once and forgotten.  
It’s a reference, a companion, and occasionally a cautionary tale.

If it stops even *one* Christmas 'goat' from slipping, it’s already paying for itself.
