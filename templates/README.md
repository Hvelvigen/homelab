# Templates

This directory is the Hvelvigen **shortcut drawer** — the place where all the reusable bits live, from the tiny one-liner snippets to the “drop this into Proxmox and watch an entire machine appear like you’ve summoned it with ancient runes” builds.

Not everything here is small.  
Not everything here is big.  
But everything here saves you time, sanity, and at least one future argument with past-you.

You’ll find templates for:

- single-service Docker Compose snippets  
- full multi-container **stacks** (the “I want an ecosystem, not a container” option)  
- VM definitions for Proxmox and Hyper-V that handle the boring setup work  
- Host Service Layer and Service Pattern skeletons  
- documentation starting points  
- anything else that’s too useful to rebuild from scratch every time inspiration strikes

The point of this directory isn’t to be fancy — it’s to be **ready**.  
Ready to copy.  
Ready to tweak.  
Ready to deploy.  
Ready to rescue you from the 03:00 moment when you remember you solved this problem six months ago but have absolutely no idea where that file went.

Use these templates however you need.  
They exist so that when you say “boom,” something actually happens — and ideally doesn’t explode.

If even one of these saves you from reinventing a wheel that never needed reinventing, that’s time you can spend on something far more interesting — and that’s rather nice, isn’t it?
